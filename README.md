# RWS boot manifest for `repo`

Quick "getting started" guide:

* Install `repo` on your system.  (On OS X, `brew install repo` will do the right thing.)
* `repo init -u git@github.com:pebble-dev/rws-manifest.git`.  Or, if you prefer HTTPS, `repo init -u https://github.com/pebble-dev/rws-manifest.git`
* `repo sync`
